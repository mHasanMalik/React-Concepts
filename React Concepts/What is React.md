# Q. What is react ?

> A. React is a javascript library to build user interfaces. A client-side javascript library. All about building modern, reactive user interfaces for the web. In react, we use a declarative, component-focused approach.


React is all about `components`
> Because all the user interfaces in the end are made up of components.

React used a `declarative approach` compared to impreitive approach. The old javascript coding style used impreitive approach.
e.g The following is what the impreitive approach looks like:
```
const para = document.createElement('p');
para.textContent = 'This is the content of the paragraph';
document.getElementById('root').append(para);
```

Compared to the above. The reach uses a declarative appraoch with the help of `JSX`.
You can find more about `JSX` in this directory.
