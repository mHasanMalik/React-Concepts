> # Q. Benefits of using Arrow functions ?
> A. The syntax is a bit shorter, since you don't have to use the "function" keyword everytime. The second reason requires you to have some previous knowledge with JS. Arrow functions solves the problems with the "this" keyword. If you have worked with JS before. You'll know that the "this" keyword not always refers to the same context you expected. In arrow functions, It will be always keep its context and not change it on the runtime.
